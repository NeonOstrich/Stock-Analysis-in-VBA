# VBA-challenge
# Unit 2 Project: VBA

This is an assignment that I completed for the George Washington University Data Analytics Bootcamp, focused on analysis in VBA.

## Background

In this project, I am performing analysis on two documents containing stock data.

This analysis was first performed on stock data which was aranged alphabeticaly with
each starting letter containing a distinct group caled "alphabetical_testing". This
dataset was used as it had an identical layout and smaller size than the focus of
our analysis which is the "Multiple_year_stock_data".

Once the analysis was perfected using the testing data, it was next performed on
the "Multiple_year_stock_data" dataset, which contains stock data over the course
of 3 years: 2018, 2019, and 2020. This dataset includes over 2.26 million
individual entries.


## Organization

In both datasets, I first created a list of each distinct stock, including their
ticker, yearly change, percent change, and total stock volume traded. I then
analyzed this further to determine the stocks with the greatest percent increase,
greatest percent decrease, and the greatest volume traded.

For the "Multiple_year_stock_data" dataset, this analysis was performed for every
year which we had data for, 2018, 2019, and 2020.

##Insights

One notable insight from this analysis is that the stock RKS posted the greatest
percent decrease in value in 2018 and 2019, and although this trend did not continue
in 2020, RKS still posted a 88.65% decrease. 

This analysis can be used to track stock performance over multiple years in order
to determine trends and inform future investment stock market action.
